## What is MM NYC?

Matcha Madness NYC began as an idea for a fun personal project to further develop my full stack application building skills. I am a matcha latte aficionado who recently moved to NYC and quickly became enamored with the city's plethora of matcha cafes to choose from. Having kept a running notes app list on my phone, I thought there must be a more efficient way to share my love for the drink with friends. What better way to combine wanting share my favorite cafes with friends + my love for website design than to build an excessively complicated website?
